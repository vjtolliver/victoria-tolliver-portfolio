# victoria-tolliver-portfolio

## Description

This application will showcase a new web developer's starter prtfolio. The portfolio was created to capture the attention of any new possible employers and or, clients. In this project you will find a navigation bar with links to the three main sections of the webpage including, "Meet Me", "My Projects", and "Contact Information. Clicking on the links will take you straight to that section. In the Meet me portion, you will find a picture of the web developer and a short snippet of what services they offer to the public. In the My Projects portion you will find a link to the developer's first deployed project by clicking on the title in the box. You can also note that this application is bigger to gain priority focus of whoever visits the site, this is the developer's best work. You will also find links to the developer's other applications, and if these applications don't exist yet, they will be taken to a "coming soon" google images link. This portion of the site was a little bit harder to code and format. To fix these problems, trial-and-error with flexbox properties were utilized. In the last portion of the webpage, you'll find contact information for the developer including, an email, phone number, and linked "LinkedIn" profile.
